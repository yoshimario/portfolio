    <p><em>All About Me:</em></p>
    <p>My name is <strong>Sean Wilson</strong> and I am currently in my early 30's. My education has been a very interesting ride and took a total of 9 years to get my first <em>Bachelor's of Arts in Digital Cinema with a Minor in Videogame Design and Development</em> from DePaul University. I then ended up taking an additional degree later an <em>Associates of Science in Cybersecurity and Networking</em> at Tacoma Community College.</p>
    <p>I have had an extensive job history throughout the last 15+ years. Most of my jobs have been customer service focused and not the ideal career for me. Most the jobs have been in the retail store environment or in the food service industry. The few jobs that I have done outside these industries have been much easier for me to stay with for a longer period of time. Currently I work in a warehouse environment and am looking to find a career in the IT industry.</p>
    <p>Why am I now interested in <strong>programming</strong> now?</p> Well this has been something that I have been wanting to learn more about for quite awhile. I just kept putting it off because of my bad experiences with the coding 10+ years ago. I learned an older version of HTML back in the day over 10 years ago. One of my first actual computer languages was an old outdated language called QBASIC it was a huge turn off in the start to my learning how to program. I then suffered having to read huge textbooks taking C++ and Java at the same time in a classroom environment on my own and learned nothing and barely passed the classes. Now that I am tired of being stuck not having a career that pays well I am going to give coding a chance. Epicodus is my next hope to getting a better chance at learning how to program. I want to move abroad to Europe ideally Finland when this pandemic allows for travelling.</p>
    <p>I have learned many things over my lifetime and have skills in computers, graphic design, customer service skills, and some Microsoft Office Certifications that I have obtained. I enjoy spending time with my pet birds. There are many hobbies that I enjoy and can be found in the list below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Travelling</li>
        <li>Photography</li>
        <li>Videogames</li>
        <li>Motorcycle Riding</li>
