    <p><em>All About Me:</em></p>
    <p>My name is <strong>Sean Wilson</strong> and I am currently in my early 30's. My education has been a very interesting ride and took a total of 9 years to get my first <em>Bachelor's of Arts in Digital Cinema with a Minor in Videogame Design and Development</em> from DePaul University. I then ended up taking an additional degree later an <em>Associates of Science in Cybersecurity and Networking</em> at Tacoma Community College.</p>
